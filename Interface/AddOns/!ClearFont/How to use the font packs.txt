So, you've downloaded ClearFont, and you want to change the fonts! What to do?
==============================================================================

Open the ClearFont.lua and ClearFontAddons.lua files and look at the first part of section A.
By changing the CLEAR_FONT_BASE section, you can choose a different pack!


For example to change from Perspective Sans (the default) to, say, Bitstream Vera - change the following line from:

	local CLEAR_FONT_BASE = "Interface\\AddOns\\!ClearFont\\Fonts\\PerspectiveSans\\";

to

	local CLEAR_FONT_BASE = "Interface\\AddOns\\!ClearFont\\Fonts\\Vera\\";


See the Interface/AddOns/!ClearFont/Fonts folder shown above to see what the different font folder choices!
It's very simple, I assure you ...


I've had a look in those folders, what is the "Main folder font files" folder for??
===================================================================================

Ah, now that is for the infamous "Step Two"!
When changing font packs by the above method, it's a good idea to copy the four oddly named font files from the font pack folder of your choiceto your [WoW folder]/Fonts directory.

It's not essential, but it can help in case you have problems with some addons.


I want more font choices!
=========================

You can create your own - just see how I've done it, and do the same.

OR!

You can download more packs from the official website - visit www.clearfont.co.uk!
You may be surprised with what you find ;)

Cheers!
